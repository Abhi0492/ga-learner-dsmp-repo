### Project Overview

 This project is about predicting  insurance claims grants to the rightful policy holders.


### Learnings from the project

 I have learnt when to use Linear Regression and when not to use Linear Regression when the dataset or the problem statement represents a classification problem wherein I can only use classification related models like Logistic Regression in this case.
